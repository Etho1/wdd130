<h1>About me</h1>

<h2>Ethan Spencer</h2>
<p>I am currently studying Software engineering, and I am looking to potentially delve into software development.
    I enjoy drumming, skateboarding, playing games, both digital and board games. I also love driving in my car for any distance, a highlight would be the twelve hour drive 
    from the lush green of Portland Oregon to the elevated flat plain of Idaho. I work at Crumbl Cookies back in Oregon, so naturally I love to bake.

<p>Something I love about BYU-Idaho is the sense of the spirit you feel all around campus and for miles around, it is so powerful in every room you enter.
    I think learning about web design is a super critical part of the world we live in now. I think we are honestly still in the somewhat early stages of 
    web design and development, there has been and there will be so much prograss made. So jumping in now and getting a foot in the door will benefit
    me for my career and life.

    I have been a member of the church since I was born. A favorite quote I have is from Elder Lawrence E. Corbridge in his talk in conference
    He says "Life is hard for all of us, but life is also simple. We have only two choices. We can either follow the Lord and be endowed with 
    His power and have peace, light, strength, knowledge, confidence, love, and joy, or we can go some other way, any other way, whatever other way, 
    and go it alone. Without His support, without His power, without guidance, in darkness, turmoil, doubt, grief, and despair. And I ask, Which way is easier?"
