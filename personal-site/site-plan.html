      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My company informs bodybuilders and casual gym goers alike of the highest rated supplements and strategies for whatever fitness goal they have in mind. Think, last time you went to the gym, did you know exactly what to be working on? Or did you wander around, overwhelmed by all the options, and then just stick to things you know? This is a problem many beginner gym goers encounter. My company, along with its affordable subscription fee, takes input from experienced bodybuilders, and professionals alike, and informs you of how, when, and what to exercise based on your schedule. As well as the tools and equipment to assist in that process.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <section class="intro">
          <h2 class="content-bold">Intro</h2>
          <p>We strive to provide unbiased information on what we do in the fitness industry. Whatever your goal may be, it is worth the effort to get the best, most refined information on what will launch your journey into motion. Our goal is to remove the anxiety and “FOWO” (or Fear Of Working Out). We want to help you to find out what the gym has to offer you.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="advisors">
          <h2 class="content-bold">Advisors</h2>
          <p>Our site is a central hub for all things gym related. We help you to dive into this lifestyle. We will help you dive into dozens of tips from professional bodybuilders, athletes, and trainers on how to stay motivated and committed to making a change, or improving your experience in the gym. We also provide short histories and accomplishments of our athletic advisors, and how they came to be who they are.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="encouragement">
          <h2 class="content-bold">Encouragement</h2>
          <p>We give you real timelines for reaching a certain goal. In the world today with so much social media clouding around the gym and success stories, it can be confusing or even discouraging when you approach the thought of getting into the gym. You might think that many of the people you see on social media have been working out since their early years when in reality all it takes is diligence and patience. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="muscles">
          <h2 class="content-bold">Guides</h2>
          <p>We are also committed to showing and educating you on what exercises are most efficient to work and grow the desired muscle group. We go into some of the common misconceptions about exercises and fitness practices in general. Again, with so much social media covering the gym, there are also a shocking amount of misinformed influencers.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="routines">
          <h2 class="content-bold">Routines</h2>
          <p>At Gym Guru we also will show you some of the most popular training splits and routines that will work for you. We all have different schedules and motivations for going to the gym, so we will cater to some of the basic schedules that you can try.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="supplements">
          <h2 class="content-bold">Supplements</h2>
          <p>We will also dive into the different aspects of supplements and the dangers of other more unorthodox chemicals. In this industry, there are hundreds of different high, and low-quality products that have different goals in mind. We at Gym Guru aim to filter out all the companies that have less than desirable goals in mind, and only provide you with the best supplements for you to consider using. We will dive into what is important in pre-workouts and protein powders, and how flavors play into the mix. We also will warn you about the dangers of steroids and how they are perceived on social media today.</p>
