                <h1>PUSH PULL LEGS</h1>
                <h4>Push Pull Legs is a widely used and accomodating workout split that can fit a busy schedule. You can work the split three times a week, or six days a week depending on how hard you want to push yourself.</h4>
                <p>Each day follows a specific group of muscles that work together.</p>
                <p>The push day consists of chest, shoulder, and tricep exercises. The pull day consists of back, traps, biceps, and rear deltoid muscles. The back has many different muscles working, and the goal is to work all of them with some compound exercises. Finally, the last day is leg day, which as you might guess, is all about working all the muscles in the legs.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>FAT LOSS SPLIT</h1>
                <h4>A cardio split is similar to the push pull leg split, however, this one incorporates a mid-week rest day, as well as the weekend rest days, and also puts a day of cario in.</h4>
                <p>This split is a little more up to the user, you will do a three version of the PPL split, but you add in a day of cardio wherever in the week you might need a break from working your muscles. Cardio helps with fat loss, and an extra rest day lets your body recover and repair muscles for the week.</p>
